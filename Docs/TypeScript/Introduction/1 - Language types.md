### Static language types

Examples:
- C++
- Java
- C#

This type of languages we set the variable type, and its value cannot be changed for other data type besides of a string.

```Java
String foo = "Hello, world!!";
foo = 2024; // An incompatible types error
```
### Dynamic language types

Examples:
- Java Script
- Python
- PHP
- Perl

This type of languages we can define a variable, and we can change its value for any type of data.
```Js
var foo = "Hello, world!!"
foo = 43 // Any error
```

#### What does Type Script?

- Data types
- Error messages in real time
- Gives the code to the compiler
- Autocomplete code

The Js compiler doesn't understand the typescript code, It need to be converted into **js** code.

foo.ts -> tsc -> foo.js
This is called transpiling, the TS compiler traduces the ts code to JS code providing similar level of abstraction.
